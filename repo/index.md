### Outside of Classes
> I try my best to fit in some time to get involved with some technological research labs on campus. In particular, I have worked with the WCSNG and Wang Robotics Lab but am working towards a new position at the Advanced Robotics and Controls Lab.
> I enjoy hanging out with my friends in my free time, cooking and eating new foods, playing video games (COD Zombies), skateboarding, going on hikes, and traveling.

### Past Work Experience
1. Amazon, Hardware Development Engineer Intern, Summer 2022

3. theCoderSchool, Computer Programming and Robotics Instructor, 2021
4. Cliosoft, Software Development Intern, 2021

### Miscellaneous
My favorite git command is `git diff` since it helps me quickly see which file changes have not been staged yet.
